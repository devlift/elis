<p>This form is used to add a course to this curriculum.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Course</b><br />
    The course added to this curriculum.
  </li><br />
  <li><b>Position</b><br />
    The position of this course within the curriculum (i.e. the order this course
    is meant to be taken in).  If you wish for two courses to be taken at the same
    time, give them a matching position value.  For instance, if you wish a user
    being enrolled into a track created from this curriculum to start two courses
    right away, they should both have a position value of 1.
