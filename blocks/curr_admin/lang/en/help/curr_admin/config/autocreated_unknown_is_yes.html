<p>Moodle courses that are linked to ELIS classes are marked as having been
auto-created or created manually since ELIS 1.8.7.  For courses created prior
to 1.8.7, the auto-created status is unknown.  This setting indicates whether
these courses should be treated as having been auto-created or not.</p>

<p>Currently, this only affects the functionality for copying curricula to a
cluster.</p>
