<p>Automatically set a Moodle user's ID number to be the same as his/her
username if he/she does not have one already set.</p>

<p>If a Moodle user does not have an ID number, then no corresponding user will
be created in the Curriculum Management system.</p>

<p>However, changing a user's ID number may result in duplicate users within the Curriculum Management system, so this option should be turned off if users will be created in Moodle before they are assigned a permanent ID number.</p>

<p>In general, this option should be set to off unless a user's ID number will
always be the same as his/her username.  However, the default is on for
backwards compatibility.</p>
