<h1>Track Class Editing Help</h1>

<p>This form is used to add a class to this track.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Class</b><br />
    The class added to this track.
  </li><br />
  <li><b>Use a start and end date?</b><br />
    Select no to create a class with no start and end date.  When users are enrolled
    into this class they won't be enrolled from the class start date to the class
    end date.  Instead they will be enrolled for the class length (as defined in
    the course record) from the time of enrolment.  For example: if the course has
    a length of 4 months and the user is enrolled today, they will be able to
    access the class for the next four months.<br /><br />
    <b>NOTE:</b> If you are editing a class that already has no start and end date
    and you wish to change this, make sure you set this option to <i>Yes</b> before
    you select a date value, otherwise it won't be saved.
  </li><br />
  <li><b>Manually set end date?</b><br />
    If checked, the value specified for the end date will be used.  If not checked,
    the default action of calculating the end date based on the length of the course
    this class is built from will be used.
  </li><br />
  <li><b>Start Date</b><br />
    This is the date that this course will start.  The end date is automatically
    set based on the length of this class (as defined in the course record).
  </li><br />
  <li><b>Position</b><br />
    The position of this class within the track (i.e. the order this class
    is meant to be taken in).  If you wish for two classes to be taken at the same
    time, give them a matching position value.  For instance, if you wish a user
    being enrolled into this track to start two classes right away, they should
    both have a position value of 1.
  </li>
</ul>
