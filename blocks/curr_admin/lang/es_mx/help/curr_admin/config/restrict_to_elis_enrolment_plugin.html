<p>If this setting is set, then ELIS will not enrol a user in an ELIS class
that is linked with a Moodle class that uses an enrolment plugin other than the
ELIS enrolment plugin.</p>

<p>In brief, if an ELIS class is:</p>
<ul>
<li>not linked to a Moodle class: it is enrollable</li>
<li>linked to a Moodle class that uses the ELIS enrolment plugin: it is
enrollable</li>
<li>linked to a Moodle class that does not use the ELIS enrolment plugin: it is
<em>not</em> enrollable</li>
</ul>
<p>This does not affect enrolments from Moodle.</p>
