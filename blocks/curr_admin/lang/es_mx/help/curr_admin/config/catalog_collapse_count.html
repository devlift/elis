Number of curricula to display before automatically collapsing: This is referring to a users view of curricula 
in their Learning Plan folder. In collapsed view, curricula only show the title. In expanded view, the courses in 
the curricula are also shown. The user can also expand and collapse the view of curricula in their Learning Plan 
folder manually.
