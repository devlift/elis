<p>If this cluster will be populated from custom profile fields, select the
custom profile field name from this drop-down menu and the requested value from
the input control directly below it.  To create a cluster populating based on two
profile fields or options, use the second set of controls in addition to the first set.
If clusters will be populated manually, these settings should be left to their defaults.</p>
